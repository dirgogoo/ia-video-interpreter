# Generic Analysis Focus

Pay attention to:

- **Main Subject**: What/who is the primary focus?
- **Actions**: What's happening in the video?
- **Key Objects**: Important items, people, or elements
- **Text Content**: Any visible text (titles, subtitles, captions)
- **Scene Changes**: Major visual transitions
- **Context**: Overall setting and mood

**Audio Priority: MEDIUM** - Balanced audio-visual analysis.

Example correlation:
- Audio at 2.5s: "This demonstrates quantum entanglement"
- Visual at frame 2: Presenter gesturing, microscope lenses visible
- Correlation: "Presenter explaining concept, using microscope visual metaphor for observation"
