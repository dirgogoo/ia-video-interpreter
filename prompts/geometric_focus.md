# Geometric Reconstruction Focus

Pay special attention to:

- **Shapes**: Identify geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, polygons, 3D objects)
- **Measurements**: Extract any numerical measurements mentioned in audio
- **Spatial Relationships**: Describe how objects relate in space (above, beside, inside)
- **Dimensions**: Note any dimension information (width, height, depth, angles)
- **Construction Steps**: If showing how to build/draw something, document the sequence

**Audio Priority: HIGH** - Measurements are often spoken, not shown visually.

Example correlation:
- Audio at 5.2s: "The base measures 10 centimeters"
- Visual at frame 5: Shows ruler next to rectangular base
- Correlation: "Base dimension of 10cm confirmed by ruler in frame"
